UniFoil is a Universal Dataset of Airfoils in Transitional and Turbulent Regimes for Subsonic and Transonic Flows for Machine Learning.
It consists of 500,000 simulations covering transitional and fully turbulent flows across incompressible to compressible regimes for 2D airfoils.
UniFoil features include the following:

- 400,000 fully-turbulent airfoil simulations
- 50,000 natural laminar flow (NLF) airfoil simulations in fully turbulent regime
- 50,000 NLF airfoil simulations in the transition regime.

The dataset can be found here - https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/VQGWC4
