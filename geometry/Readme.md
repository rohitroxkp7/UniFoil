NLF folder contains the code to generate the NLF airfoils.
Just run the **genairfoil.py** code and airfoilsys.txt should get generated.
It is a large file.

Next, run the **dat_file_export.py** and the .dat files containing airfoil coordinates in x,y in the second and third columns should pop up in a locally created folder called airfoil_dat_files.

Finally, use the **data_file_load_and_plot.py** code to load and plot the airfoil profiles for any airfoil of your choice.

FT folder just run the **create_airfoil_coordinates.py** and the .dat files should come up in the airfoil_dat folder locally created.
**plotairfoil.py** has the code for visualizing the airfoil.
